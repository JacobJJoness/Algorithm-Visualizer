#Insertion Sort Visualizer

##Description
This Python program is a visualizer for the insertion sort algorithm using the Pygame library. It generates a graphical representation of the sorting process, allowing you to see how insertion sort works in action. You can play and pause the visualization, restart it, and observe the bars being sorted in real-time.



##Features
Play/Pause: You can start and pause the sorting visualization using the "Play/Pause" button.
Restart: The "Restart" button allows you to generate a new set of random bars and start the visualization over.
Dynamic Bar Count: You can change the number of bars to be sorted by adjusting the num_bars variable in the code.
Color Gradient: The bars are colored using a gradient that represents their height, ranging from blue (shortest) to red (tallest).
Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed on your computer. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website.

Install Pygame: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install Pygame:

Copy code
pip install pygame
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

Run the Program: Navigate to the directory containing the code and run the script by executing:

Copy code
python insertion_sort_visualizer.py
Usage
When you run the program, the graphical window will open, and the bars will start sorting automatically.
Click the "Play/Pause" button to pause and resume the sorting process.
Click the "Restart" button to generate a new set of random bars and restart the visualization.
Customization
You can customize the program by adjusting the following variables in the code:

num_bars: Change the number of bars to be sorted.
bar_heights: Modify the initial heights of the bars by changing the list of random heights.
